// Top 25 Front End System Design Interview Questions

// Question 1 Explain the concept of responsive web design and why it is important.
// Ans: Responsive web design (RWD) is an approach to web design that makes web pages render well on various devices and window or screen sizes. It is important because it improves user experience, SEO, and reduces development time and cost.
        // 1. Mobile usage: Increasing number of users access web on mobile devices
        // 2. User experience: Provides optimal viewing experience across devices
        // 3. SEO benefits: Google favors mobile-friendly websites in search rankings
        // 4. Cost-effective: Single website works for all devices, reducing development and maintenance costs
        // 5. Future-proof: Adapts to new device sizes and resolutions
        // 6. Consistency: Maintains brand consistency across different platforms
        // 7. Increased reach: Accessible to users regardless of their device

// Question 2 What are some best practices for optimizing website performance?
// Ans: Some best practices include minimizing HTTP requests, leveraging browser caching, optimizing images and videos, using content delivery networks (CDNs), and minimizing server response time.
        // Use a Content Delivery Network (CDN): Distribute content across multiple, geographically diverse server
        // Optimize images: Use appropriate formats (JPEG for photos, PNG for graphics), Compress images, Implement lazy loading
        // Minify CSS, JavaScript, and HTML: Remove unnecessary characters without changing functionality
        // Reduce server response time: Optimize application logic, Improve server configuration            // Implement proper caching strategies: Browser caching, Server-side caching

// Question 3 How would you implement lazy loading for images on a web page?
// Ans: Lazy loading involves loading images only when they are about to come into the viewport. This can be achieved by setting the image src attribute to a placeholder initially and then updating it with the actual image source when it is about to be displayed.
            {/* <img src="image.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Description"> */}
            // Use a small, low-resolution image as a placeholder. 
                // <img src="placeholder.jpg" data-src="image.jpg" alt="Description" class="lazy">
            // Native lazy loading (modern browsers):
                // <img src="image.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Description">
            // Progressive loading: Load a low-resolution version first, then replace with high-resolution.
                // <img src="low-res.jpg" data-src="high-res.jpg" alt="Description" class="progressive">

// Question 4 Explain the concept of Single Page Applications (SPAs) and their advantages.
// Ans: Concept of SPAs:
            // Web apps that load a single HTML page
            // Dynamically update content without full page reloads
            // Use AJAX and HTML5 to create fluid user experience.
        // Key characteristics:
            // 1. Client-side rendering
            // 2. Dynamic content updates
            // 3. Asynchronous data loading. 
                    // Async & Sync : 
                            // Asynchronous is not occurring at the same time, while synchronous is occurring in real-time or near real-time.
                            // Async is multi-thread, which means operations or programs can run in parallel. Sync is a single-thread, so only one operation or program will run at a time.
